An Australian sheep  that made headlines in 2015 for the record-breaking weight of its fleece has died. The Merino named Chris, believed to be aged about 10, was found dead on Tuesday morning by its  minders, having died of old age,  Kate Luke, co-founder  of the Canberra-based Little Oak Sanctuary, a charity sheltering more than  180 farm animals, said. “We are heartbroken at the loss of this sweet, wise, friendly soul,” the sanctuary said on Facebook. “Chris is known as the world record-holder for having grown the heaviest fleece on record. “He was so much more than this, so very much more, and we will remember him for all that he was — someone, not something.” In 2015, Chris  was discovered on the northern outskirts of Australian capital Canberra, struggling to walk under the weight of his  wool, which had not be sheared in more than five years. The 40.2kg  of wool removed from the sheep  made Chris the unofficial carrier of the world’s heaviest fleece, dethroning New Zealand sheep Big Ben, which was found carrying nearly 29kg  of wool in 2014. — Reuters
