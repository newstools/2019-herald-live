The teacher has resigned with immediate effect and the school is conducting a full investigation. “The school takes this matter extremely seriously and requests the public to respect the dignity and privacy of those concerned.” The teacher, who was a sports coach, had also held other positions at the school. The former part-time model married her long-term boyfriend in 2018. Her social media profiles have been deleted.
