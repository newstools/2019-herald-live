The postmortem, which was done on Thursday morning, indicated that Britons Susanna Naylor, 54, her husband, Christopher, 58, and charity co-founder Miranda Harris, 66, died from blunt force trauma — either caused by the impact when the bakkie hit the bridge barrier or when the vehicle plunged into the water — and did not drown. This was confirmed by an  official who is not authorised to speak to the  media. The official postmortem report will be handed to detectives for their investigation. Harris’s husband, Peter, survived the crash but is unconscious and in a critical condition in St George’s Hospital. Two of Peter’s children have since  arrived in  Port Elizabeth to be by his bedside.
