The 2019 Herald Matric of the Year winner says he owes everything he has achieved in life to God.

Sachin scooped the overall title as well as the Cultural Category award. The 18-year-old said his main drive had been to make his parents proud, adding that he pushed himself to be the best version of himself he could be. "We have been through a lot as a family and it has been a long and incredible journey. "My school is not one of the cheapest schools but my parents put me there and told me to do my best while they take care of the rest.

Humbled by the award, Alungile said he was happy to be heading back to his home town, Mqanduli, with the excellence award adding that it would serve as a beacon of hope for every underprivileged child showing they too could achieve anything they wanted.

"Coming from Mthatha our parents usually set standards according to how they lived their lives in the past. "Mama, Tata, I made it!
