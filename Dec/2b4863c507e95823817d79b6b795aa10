Eskom has announced unprecedented stage 6 load-shedding from 6pm on Monday. The power utility said that this was a "shortage of capacity". "This follows a technical problem at Medupi Power Station impacting additional generation supply," Eskom said on Twitter. Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Kupido Baron said, however, that the municipality had decided to continue with stage 4 load-shedding. This is a developing story.
