Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Mongameli Bobani has been removed through a motion of no confidence. The majority of the parties in the council chamber – DA, ANC, Patriotic Alliance, COPE,  ACDP and AIC – voted in favour of DA councillor Morne Steyn’s motion. Shortly before it came down the vote, Bobani announced that he would dissolve his mayoral committee. He left the chamber immediately after he was ousted.
