Eskom announced on Thursday that it would implement stage 2 load-shedding from 4pm until 11pm. The power utility sent out a brief alert shortly after 3pm. “Eskom regrets that Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 16:00 to 23:00 today due to a shortage of capacity,” it said on Twitter. After a winter without power cuts, Eskom resumed load-shedding in October when multiple unplanned outages and other issues took more than 20% of generation capacity out of the system, TimesLIVE reported.
