Camps for boys that combine fun with serious education on the dangers of illegal, underage  initiation could help to protect  youths from making poor decisions  under peer pressure. The Eastern Cape continues to be rocked by initiate deaths, mostly underage and in illegal initiation schools. Man and  Boy Foundation  director Nkululeko Nxesi said  teaching  boys about the dangers of illegal initiation, and the beauty of the rite when  done legally, could help curb  illegal circumcision and deaths. For almost three weeks  the foundation  has held a  camp in Tsolo  with 111 boys, aged  16-17, in attendance. The camp is free  but the boys must have permission from  parents and  traditional leaders to attend. Every initiation season,  the foundation organises a boys’ camp, roping in teachers, life orientation trainers, sport coaches, peer educators, youth ambassadors and nurses. Nxesi said the foundation was embarking on a mentorship and empowerment programme where  boys were  taught about their  rights, legal and medical compliance when attending  initiation, purity, life skills, the dangers of illegal circumcision,  peer pressure and the dangers of crime.   In the 2019 winter season, 17 initiates died in the province and in the 2018 summer season 21  died.  “Some are abducted to illegal initiation schools, while others go to illegal  schools due to peer pressure.” The camps  targeted  ages  12-17, Nxesi said. The foundation assisted in the rescue of several  initiates  this  initiation season. Of the 25  deaths  this season, seven were  in the Chris Hani district, seven in Amathole, four in OR Tambo, three in Joe Gqabi, two in Alfred Nzo, one in Sarah Baartman and one in the  Bay.
