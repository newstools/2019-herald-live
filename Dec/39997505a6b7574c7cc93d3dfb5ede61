Eskom implemented stage 6 load-shedding for the first time on Monday and has announced that it has started planning for stages 7 and 8. What does this mean and how does it affect you? Stage 6 SA has never experienced anything higher than stage 4 load-shedding, with stages 6 and  7 indicating that Eskom will shed 6,000MW and 7,000MW respectively. Stage 6 doubles the frequency of stage 3 and, according to Eskom, this means load-shedding will be scheduled over four-day periods for four hours at a time. Stage 8 Should Eskom escalate load-shedding to stage 8, SA residents will be without power up to six times a day or 12 hours, depending on the day’s schedule. This stage will shed 8,000MW from the grid. Stage 8 doubles the frequency of stage 4. 'Controlled way' According to Eskom, load-shedding is a controlled way to make sure the national power grid remains stable. “The higher the load-shedding stage, the more frequent you will experiencing load-shedding. “The higher the stage, the greater the number of customers who will be affected across the country. “Generally, load-shedding in stage 8 will result in customers having electricity for 50% of the day.” NB: On Tuesday, Eskom downgraded load-shedding from stage 6 to stage 4. Politicians weigh in Taking to social media, politicians had much to say about the situation.
