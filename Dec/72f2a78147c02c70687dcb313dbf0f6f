The Mandela Bay Development Agency has met the Summerstrand Special Rates Area team and is supporting their initiative, agency  spokesperson Luvuyo Bangazi confirmed on Monday. Bangazi said because the MBDA focused on its mandate area in Central and Richmond Hill, it would not be directly involved in the Summerstrand SRA process. “But an SRA in our view is one of the effective tools to achieve urban renewal so we did meet them to provide guidance and talk through the requirements.” There could be a downside with an SRA, however, and this was communicated and discussed, he said. “In the US, it has been shown that it can have the unintended consequence of creating a social divide. “This ‘gentrification’ can mean some residents, often the elderly, can no longer afford the increased rates and they are forced out of the neighbourhood.” Bangazi said to meet the requirements to become an SRA, certain steps needed to be followed: In the Bay, an SRA for Richmond Hill is already in operation and a new one for Central was approved past week. Initiatives had also been launched in Kini Bay, Walmer Heights and Parson’s Hill, Bangazi said.
