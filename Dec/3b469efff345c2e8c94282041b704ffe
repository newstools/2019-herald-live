There were mixed reactions to the ousting of Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Mongameli Bobani through a no-confidence motion on Thursday. Bobani had previously survived four attempts to remove him. And as all the drama unfolded in the council chamber, Twitter users had a lot to say about the developments. Adding fuel to the fire, UDM president Bantu Holomisa blamed the axing of Bobani on his refusal to “approve favours”. Some Twitter users did not hold back in expressing their disappointment at Holomisa for failing to act against Bobani.
