The Zondo commission of inquiry into state capture resumes on Friday. An investigator for the state capture inquiry this week corroborated evidence by former Bosasa employee Richard le Roux, detailing various security upgrades that the company installed for former prisons boss Linda Mti. Earlier this year, Le Roux testified that - apart from his normal duties in the company - he headed a special projects team that oversaw the installation of home security upgrades for high-profile politicians and state officials at the request of Bosasa boss Gavin Watson. Le Roux claimed upgrades were installed to properties belonging to, among others, ANC national chairman and mining minister Gwede Mantashe, environmental affairs minister Nomvula Mokonyane, former department of correctional services chief financial officer Patrick Gillingham, and Mti. The commission's investigator Patrick Mlambo testified about an inspection he conducted in February, along with Le Roux, of two properties belonging to Mti in the Eastern Cape.
