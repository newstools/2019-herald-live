President Cyril Ramaphosa is no stranger to book shops in South Africa and his visits are often followed by pictures from other shoppers who happened to be in the right place at the right time. This time, Mzansi wanted to know exactly what was on the president's reading list and had one suggestion for a  top read. On Wednesday, Exclusive Books in Hyde Park, Johannesburg, posted a snap of Ramaphosa  with a staff member. In the corner of the image, Ramaphosa is  holding a book, but  the title is unclear. Twitter immediately suggested that the pres buy a copy of Gangster State: Unravelling Ace Magashule's Web of Capture, by journalist Pieter-Louis Myburgh. The book has dominated headlines since extracts were first published on Sunday, firmly placing Magashule at the forefront of alleged links to state capture in the Free State. The ANC first dismissed the book, calling it fake news. The party later said it would retract its statement on the book. Finance minister Tito Mboweni revealed   that he had bought the book, but said  he wanted to make up his own mind about the evidence presented. Meanwhile, Twitter detectives weren't able to figure out which book Ramaphosa had purchased, but did point him in Myburgh's direction.
