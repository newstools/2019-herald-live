Police are here, but they are waiting for a forensic pathology vehicle,” he said. A second student, accused of being the accomplice of the deceased, also sustained serious injuries. SRC spokesperson Asanda Mtshezi confirmed the incident, but said details  were still  unclear. “A student has been reportedly killed by other students at Zamukulungisa site this evening. The information we have at the moment is that he was involved in stealing other students belongings,” she said. Police and university spokespersons were not immediately available for comment.
