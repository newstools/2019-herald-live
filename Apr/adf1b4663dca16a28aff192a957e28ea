The bullet-riddled body of a man was found lying on the side of the road in KwaDwesi on Thursday evening. Zipho Lungu, 27, was found lying on the pavement of Nkabinde Street in Joe Slovo at about 6pm. Police spokesperson Captain André Beetge said Lungu had been shot multiple times at close range. “The details as to what happened remain unknown. His body was found by a passer-by who alerted the police,” he said. “Several spent bullet cartridges were found scattered on the ground at the crime scene. Nothing appears to have been stolen.” Beetge added that the motive for the killing was unclear. This comes only a day after Abdul Kader Cassim, 51, was stabbed to death in Stemela Street, Korsten. The motive of his death remains unknown. Both cases are under investigation.
