Two prisoners – one an alleged murderer – escaped from the back of a moving police van while being transported back to prison on Tuesday morning. The escape happened on the R62 and N2 on-ramp, near the Kareedouw/Humansdorp turnoff, at about 11.20am. A task team is working to track the men down. Insiders have said that a police warrant officer from Joubertina police station was transporting Jason Witbooi, 22, and Bonginkosi Mgaqi, 27, from Joubertina to Patensie and then to St Albans prison, where they were awaiting trial. Witbooi is awaiting trial for a farm murder in Joubertina in 2018 and Mgaqi for a 2007 culpable homicide case. Police spokesperson Captain Gerda Swart said a search for the men at the scene was undertaken, without success. “At the N2 turnoff on the R62, a truck was driving in front of the police vehicle. “While it was reducing speed, the two prisoners escaped through the back window of the police vehicle.” “The member stopped the vehicle and contacted Humansdorp police. “A tracing team was immediately activated, and with the assistance of the K9 unit and the police airwing an extensive hunt for the escapees started. “The men managed to escape by bending the grill across the back window of the van.” Swart asked anyone with information to contact 10111 immediately.
