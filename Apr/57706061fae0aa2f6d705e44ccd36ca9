"This endorsement from the voters proves that the DA remains on track to remove the ANC from power in the Dr Beyers Naude Municipality. "Voters in rural Eastern Cape have shown that they are fed-up with the empty promises of the failing ANC government. "This increase in rural support in the Dr Beyers Naude and the DAâ€™s massive urban growth in the recent Ward 2 by-election in Nelson Mandela Bay highlights that the DA continues to grow and is ready to govern," Bhanga said.
