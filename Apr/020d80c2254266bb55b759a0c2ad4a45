Water supply will be shut down in Summerstrand, Humewood and South End for about four hours on Monday, April 15. This is to allow for the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality to carry out maintenance work. The work is to assist the city with its Water Loss Programme to help reduce water losses in the metro. Supply will be disrupted between 9am and 1pm.
