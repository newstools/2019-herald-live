"The police has the responsibility to protect the vulnerable in society and these responsibilities are taken seriously through thorough investigation, effective arrests and prosecutions. "This conviction will serve as a deterrent to potential rapists and the SAPS through its FCS units ensures that sentences such as this will bring justice to the victims of these crimes,” he said.
