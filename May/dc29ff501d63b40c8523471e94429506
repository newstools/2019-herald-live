The SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) has opened a hate speech case against Adam Catzavelos Â over his racial utterances. SAHRC spokesperson Buang Jones said they would ask the Equality Court to find that Catzavelos's utterances were hate speech and that he should pay a fine. Catzavelos posted a video of himself on a beach in Greece last year, in which he used the k-word when expressing joy that there were no black people around. "We find the k-word to be demeaning and degrading. Courts in South Africa have pronounced on the matter. We find this to be unbecoming. We hope the court will send a clear message and deter other people from making racial slurs," Jones said. He was speaking outside the Randburg Magistrate's Court, where Catzavelos appeared on Tuesday on a charge of crimen injuria. Catzavelos's case was postponed to June 13 for him to appoint a lawyer. Jones said the SAHRC would await a court date from the clerk of the Equality Court for a pretrial conference. "We've served his legal team with papers."
