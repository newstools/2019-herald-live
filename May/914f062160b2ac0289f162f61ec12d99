The ANC has retained KwaZulu-Natal, its stronghold, following the elections, but with a significantly reduced majority, securing 54.22% of the vote. The party fell just over 10 percentage points from the 64.52% it received in 2014. The province is former president Jacob Zuma's home province and was highly divided in the run-up to the ANC's elective conference in 2017, where President Cyril Ramaphosa beat Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma for the head of the party. Two months later, the ANC recalled Zuma, forcing him to resign as state president.

The ANC also managed to hold control of the Eastern Cape, Limpopo and the Free State, but again with reduced majorities.
