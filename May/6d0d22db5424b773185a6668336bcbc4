A motorist was seen speeding towards a junction in northern Thailand on May 17 2019. Rather than slow down, however, the driver crashed through a wooden hut that traffic officers sit in to monitor vehicles. Fortunately, the checkpoint was empty at the time and nobody was killed. Police believe the motorist was drunk or nodded off at the wheel.
