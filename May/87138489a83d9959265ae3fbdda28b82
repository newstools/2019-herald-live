A motorist who allegedly fled the scene after crashing into two pedestrians while he was under the influence of alcohol will apply for bail on Thursday. One of the pedestrians, a Nigerian national who had been in South Africa for only three days, Anthony Agbo, 35, died on the scene. The other pedestrian, a 26-year-old woman was taken to hospital with serious injuries. The driver, Kalvin Zirema of South End, fled the scene. He was later arrested. It has since emerged that the Audi A4 he was driving belongs to a friend. The accident took place in Beach Road, Humewood, near the La Roche Drive intersection, at about 3.50am on Sunday. Zirema, 31, appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court on Tuesday morning for culpable homicide, drunk driving and reckless and/or negligent driving. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the driver allegedly collided with two pedestrians who were standing next to a road island. “The driver then lost control of the vehicle and collided with four other stationary vehicles parked near the Humewood Hotel.” Naidu said there were no occupants in the four vehicles at the time. Additional charges will be added as the investigation continues. These could include fleeing the scene of an accident and failure to ascertain the nature of the injuries.
