A graphic video of a man violently assaulting a woman has surfaced. This comes two weeks after an assault case was opened by a Nelson Mandela University law student, Fumani Jacob, 20,Â  alleging she too was assaulted - allegedly by the same man. In a video tweet which went viral the man is seen kicking a woman who is lying on the ground. The second victim is a 25-year-old woman who - similarly to Jacob - claims to know the man personally. The woman, who refused to be named to protect her identity, said she was forced to return home after the videos - recorded during the assault in March - went viral. A second video relating to the incident has also been shared on social media but HeraldLIVE has decided not to share that video out of respect for the victim. The woman said she had initially not opened a police case out of fear as the man said during the assault that he did not care if she tried to have him arrested. "I was afraid at first ... afraid about what people would say. I was even afraid to go to the doctor because I didn't want to have to say that someone I knew personally, beat me to a pulp. "Since the videos went viral, I have switched off my cellphone." She has, however, changed her mind. "I am at home now and will be opening a case." This is a developing story.
