ANC Gauteng deputy provincial chair Panyaza Lesufi has been appointed the new MEC for finance and e-government while controversial Faith Mazibuko returns to the provincial executive as MEC for community safety. These are among names announced on Wednesday morning by premier David Makhura of individuals who will make up his administration. Lesufi has been a popular and much praised MEC for education for his hard stance on pushing ahead with transformation in the previous term. He has now been replaced with Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko. He responded to the announcement on his Twitter account, promising "not to disappoint". Meanwhile the foot-in-mouth Mazibuko was previously MEC for sport, recreation, arts and culture and was once recorded verbally attacking senior officials which resulted to her being hauled before theÂ ANC integrity commission. She has been replaced with Mbali Hlophe in her previous portfolio. The rest of the Gauteng executive council includes: "This team collectively represents the ANC's accumulated governance experience, new energy and fresh ideas required to fulfil the mandate of the 6th administration, of growing Gauteng together," said Makhura, adding that he will provide detailed reasons for the appointments on Thursday at the swearing-in ceremony.
