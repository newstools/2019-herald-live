Former president Jacob Zuma is back in the dock to face corruption charges in the Pietermaritzburg high court on Monday. Zuma's co-accused, French arms company Thales, said on Sunday it believed it "cannot obtain a fair trial". In a statement issued ahead of the court appearance on Monday to have the charges against it and Zuma permanently dropped, Thales said the circumstances of the case, which dates back a decade, meant a fair trial could not happen. "Bearing in mind the very long delay of this procedure – through no fault of Thales at all – together with a range of factors beyond its control, Thales believes it cannot obtain a fair trial, as it is entitled to under the SA constitution and international law," said the company.
