Christina Brown was born at 9.11pm, weighing nine pounds, 11 ounces, reported BBC. USA Today reported that her mother, Cametrione Moore-Brown, said “she is a little miracle at such a sad time. She is a new life among the devastation and destruction. According to The Independent, her father, Justin Brown, said “it was really exciting, especially to find some joy during a day of such tragedy".
