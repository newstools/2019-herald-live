Much jubilation greeted Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, as they arrived in South Africa's so-called "murder capital" for the first of many official engagements they'll be undertaking during their 10-day tour of southern Africa. The royal couple visited the Cape Town township of Nyanga - infamous as the place where the most murder cases were reported, according to the latest SAPS crime stats - to see the important work being done by The Justice Desk, a non-profit organisation that educates children about their rights, safety and self-awareness. Music filled the air as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were greeted by the organisation's staff, dancers and locals. Harry couldn't resist the joyful beat, prompting him to encourage one of the children he met to join him in a dance. He also stopped to admire a picture that another child had drawn. The duchess  joined some of the Capetonians in a dance, before distributing warm greetings to others who'd come out to see the couple. Among other initiatives, The Justice Desk runs self-defence classes for young women in the township - one of which the Duke and Duchess of Sussex got to witness first-hand. The pair later delivered a powerful speech about gender-based violence. “No man is born to cause harm to women. This is learned behaviour and we need to break that cycle," Prince Harry is quoted as saying on People.com. "My role is to defend my wife and be a positive role model for my son." The duchess added a personal note, telling the audience: "While I am here as a member of the royal family, I am here with you as a woman, as a wife, as a woman of colour." Later on Monday the royal couple will visit Cape Town's District Six Museum and join a community cooking activity with former residents of District Six.
