Springbok World Cup-winning winger Chester Williams has died. The University of the Western Cape, where Williams was the rugby coach, confirmed his death on Friday evening. A full statement would be issued later, the university said. Williams, star winger of the Springboks' iconic 1995 Rugby World Cup triumph, died on Friday afternoon of a suspected heart attack. He had been admitted to the Panorama Hospital in Bellville. This was also confirmed by a source close to Williams' wife, Maria. UWC spokesperson Gasant Abarder said he last communicated with Williams late on Friday morning. The last message in their WhatsApp exchange was sent at 11.55am. He said he was shocked to hear at about 6.30pm that Williams had died. "I was with him yesterday [Thursday] in a meeting, and I gave a him a lift to the university's administration block. And the guy was fine," Abarder said. "A journalist wanted to chat to him about the new beer label that he had just launched and we said goodbye and that was it. Then I got a call 30 minutes ago," he said at about 7pm on Friday. Abarder said Williams was about to travel to Japan to attend the Rugby World Cup, which starts in less than two weeks. "He was really looking forward to that. He was in really good spirits," he said. Abarder added that Williams, who celebrated his 49th birthday on August 8, had begun a recruitment drive for players for the university. "Chester was like a dad to these rugby players," he said.
