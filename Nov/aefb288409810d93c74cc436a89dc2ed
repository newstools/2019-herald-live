The fifth  annual Eastern Cape Wine Show is  heading for the Bay — and those who enjoy a fine vintage are in for a treat. Taking place in the Tsitsikamma Rooms at the Boardwalk Convention Centre on November 29 and 30, the show will sport a new look inspired by sun and sea, with about  40 exhibitors on hand to present 200 wines for sample and sale. Sparkling wine from Krone, Valdo and Boschendal will set the tone for the evening, with past regulars Boekenhoutskloof, Bonnievale, Chamonix, Glen Carlou, Hill & Dale, Neethlingshof, Jordan, Spier, Tokara and Zevenwacht also on offer. New brands at  the show include Holden Manz, Survivor, Balance, Lyngrove and Rainbow’s End among others and as usual a few select “foodie” exhibitors will be on hand to ensure wine lovers have something to snack on. The show takes place between 5pm and 9pm both evenings and tickets are available via webtickets.co.za and at the door, subject to availability. The  Early Bird price booked via webtickets.co.za by  November 17 is  R180. Tickets  will cost R200 at the door. WIN TICKETS Five lucky Weekend Post readers can win tickets to the show.
