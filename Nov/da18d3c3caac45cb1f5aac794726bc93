South Africans have united online to debate the chaos at SAA after a turbulent week. This week, the airline announced a possibility of job cuts in a bid to save about R700m. On Monday, it said it had told 5,146 employees it was embarking on a restructuring process that could lead to job losses. Workers then threatened to down tools. The National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) and the SA Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) on Wednesday served SAA and SAA Technical (Saat) with a 48-hour notice to strike.
