Flames tore through an apartment block in Paris, killing at least 10 residents in the early hours of Tuesday, after what prosecutors said looked like an arson attack. Police said they arrested a 40year-old woman who lived in the building on suspicion of starting the blaze in the upscale 16th arrondissement. Firefighters in breathing apparatus scaled ladders to rescue people stranded on balconies on the eight-storey block on Rue Erlanger. Some were hoisted down on ropes and at least one person abseiled to safety. Franceinfo radio reported that a child was among the dead, although there was no official confirmation. A further 36 people were injured, including firefighters. “It was a particularly violent fire,” Captain Clement Cognon of the Paris fire service said. Rescue crews edged along the outer ledges as colleagues sprayed water onto the building. The fire started on the upper floors after midnight and was under control by 8am, officials said. Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz said it was believed the fire was started deliberately and a woman had been detained. He said she had mental health issues. Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo wrote on Twitter that the city was in mourning after the fire, which came less than a month after a gas blast in the capital killed four people. Rue Erlanger is near the Parc des Princes soccer stadium and Roland Garros, the French Open tennis venue.
