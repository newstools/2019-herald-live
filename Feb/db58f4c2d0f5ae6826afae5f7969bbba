An ADT armed response officer was ambushed and robbed of his firearm and bulletproof vest in Motherwell on Monday night. The incident happened at about 8.10pm when the 52-year-old response officer stopped outside a spaza shop in Nkwenkwezi Street. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the armed response official was walking to the shop to get something to eat when a car approached him from behind. “Two men, one armed with a firearm, jumped out of a car and pointed the firearm at his head. The suspects then stole a firearm and demanded he hand over his bulletproof vest,” she said. “The official was then ordered to lie on the road outside the shop. "The suspects stole the response vehicle's keys and the officer's cellphone before speeding off in their getaway car.” Naidu said a case of armed robbery is under investigation.
