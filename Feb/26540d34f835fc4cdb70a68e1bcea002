Patients have been advised to access medical help at Walmer’s 14th Avenue Clinic or clinics in Central the Eastern Cape Department of Health spokesperson Lwandile Sicwetsha said after the Gqebera Clinic in Walmer Township was badly vandalised and robbed of all its ARV-stock. The clinic’s doors were locked this morning and a few patients were still milling around outside but Sicwetsha said they will only be able to start cleaning once the police have completed their investigation. He said apart from the ARV-stock being taken the damage is extensive. Security officers at the scene said they were not sure how the criminals accessed the clinic. “The clinic was badly damaged and the computer system and plumbing have been destroyed. The criminals used fire extinguishers to vandalise the building,” he said. “The destruction of health facilities is a set back in government’s efforts of bringing primary healthcare facilities within communities. The criminals are taking away rights of residents to have access to quality healthcare. The community structures in the Nelson Mandela must rise against this criminality and protect healthcare facilities from criminals. It can’t be correct that few criminals are allowed to destroy clinics and the community doesn’t do anything,” Health MEC Helen Sauls-August said. The police have called on anybody with information on the break-in, theft of anti-retroviral medication and vandalism at Gqebera Clinic to get touch with the Walmer police station. Police spokesperson captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said they are investigating charges of housebreaking, theft and malicious damage to property. Sicwetsha said they are not sure when the attack happened but can confirm that it was on Sunday. He said the facility does not have 24 hour security. Theodorus Nogampule from the Treatment Action Campaign said ARVs are a target for thieves as people smoke it to get high. A case has been opened with the police.
