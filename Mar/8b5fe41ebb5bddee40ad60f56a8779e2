A Port Elizabeth man and a suspected prostitute were arrested for allegedly fabricating a story about being kidnapped, and trying to extort money. Police spokesperson Captain Sandra Janse van Rensbug said the man and woman had been arrested in Central after allegedly lying about being abducted. “It is alleged that on Tuesday, a man went to a house in Clyde Street, Central. He spent the night there,” she said. “On Wednesday he then contacted his employer and said he was being kept against his will in Clyde Street and a ransom of R3,000 must be paid before he would be released.” Janse van Rensbug said the man’s employer was also his friend, which was why he was contacted. “After the money was paid there was another call asking for more money. The man turned to the police for help,” she said. “The police managed to set up a drop-off where more funds would be paid. “By that stage, the location of the suspects was already known.” She said when the pair left the building for the drop-off point, they were arrested. By 6pm on Thursday both had been arrested. They will appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court on Monday.
