“I stay in Motherwell, in a modest house. No-one has ever revamped my house.” This was the response of Port Elizabeth businessman and politician Mtiwabo Ndube to claims his house may have been re-modeled and paid for by Bosasa CEO Gavin Watson. Delivering testimony at the commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture on Friday, former Bosasa COO Angelo Agrizzi said he was in a car with Watson in PE when a call came through. He said Watson told the person on the phone that he should go ahead and revamp the house of a man who Agrizzi later discovered was Ndube. Agrizzi said they were in Port Elizabeth at the time trying to resolve problems they had in getting the necessary environmental approvals for the Coega SeaArk Africa project. He did not indicate if Ndube’s house was, in fact, ever revamped. Ndube said while he was involved in Bosasa as a project manager for the SeaArk project, he only ever received money from Bosasa that was related to the work he was doing. “I was retrenched when the company was not successful. The only payments I received were for work,” Ndube said.
