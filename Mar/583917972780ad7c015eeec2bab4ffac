A 10-year-old girl died after she was run over by a truck while crossing a road in Struandale on Thursday afternoon. Caris Hartnick, 10, was walking with a 16-year-old friend in Eveready Road  near the Eveready building that can be seen from the N2. Police spokesperson Johan Rheeder said the incident happened at about 4pm on Thursday when the two were walking along the roadside. “Details are sketchy as the surviving child is in shock. It appears that they were standing on the pavement waiting to cross the road when a truck pulling two trailers went by. “As the second trailer was busy passing the child (Hartnick) ran across the road,” he said. Rheeder said the truck continued driving not realising what had happened. “A witness then alerted police who in turn contacted the company. The supervisor contacted the driver of the truck who then pulled off the road and waited for the police,” he said. “She was declared dead on the scene by medics.” Rheeder said the friend who was with her was unharmed but traumatised. He said was it unclear where the children were walking to or coming from. However the EduPlanet Independent School principal, who asked not be named, confirmed the two were crossing the road from school to catch their lift home when the accident happened. A case of culpable homicide is under investigation. PLEASE NOTE: This article has been updated to include comment from the school principal. Police indicated earlier that Caris was with a 10-year-old female friend when the accident happened. However, the principal said she was with a 16-year-old friend.
