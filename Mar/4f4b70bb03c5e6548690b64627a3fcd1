Britain’s possible request for an extension to remain in the European Union beyond the March 29 deadline will not be unquestioningly accepted, an aide to French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday. “An extension is not for certain or automatic,” the aide said, echoing demands by several EU officials that British Prime Minister Theresa May lay out clear reasons why a delay would be necessary. May is scrambling to avoid a chaotic no-deal departure in 10 days’ time. EU heavyweights Germany and France have already warned they will not agree to delay Brexit simply to save the prime minister’s skin. Macron’s aide said France would assess the demand for an extension with two firm criteria. “First point: is there a plan, a strategy, to justify an extension?” the aide said. “Second point: we need to look at the impact on the European Union.” He said Britain remaining longer in the EU could mean it would take part in European Parliament elections in May, would have a seat at EU meetings and take part in decisions about the bloc’s future. Other EU member states were discussing two main options: a delay of two to three months, if May persuades them she can clinch a deal at home, or longer if May accepts that radical reworking is needed. The BBC’s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said May would ask for an extension until June 30 – which could give her another chance to get the British parliament to bless her deal – with the option of a delay of up to two years.
