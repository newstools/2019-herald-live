Protesting Nelson Mandela University (NMU) students have blocked the entrance to the South and North Campus as protest action enters its second day. About 400 protesters placed rocks and branches to prevent people from entering the campuses. The number of students participating in the strike appears to be growing as more students arrive to join the protest. They started at about 6am. Campus security has blocked part of University Way and they are diverting traffic down Gomery Avenue. Several cars line the sides of the road as people wait patiently for the entrance to be opened. One police van is on the scene. Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said:“The Humewood police are on the scene and are monitoring the situation". By 7am Naidu confirmed that the Public Order Policing Unit had been sent to assist with overseeing the protest action. NMU on Wednesday said it would enforce an interdict to protect the rights and safety of those who wish to access the campus. Conditions set out in the interdict include that protesting students cannot: - Interfere with, obstruct or disrupt university and academic activity; - Damage property; - Contravene University rules; and - Intimidate other students or staff. “Any contravention of this final order shall be in direct contempt of the court and may lead to both criminal and disciplinary action,” the NMU said in a statement.
