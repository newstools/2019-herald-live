Pope Francis assured "all New Zealanders, and in particular the Muslim community, of his heartfelt solidarity," after Friday's attacks on two mosques which left 49 people dead. The pope was "deeply saddened to learn of the injury and loss of life caused by the senseless acts of violence," Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin said in a telegram.
