Convicted former police detective Alicia Beeming, who pleaded guilty to a charge of defeating the ends of justice, is expected to be sentenced in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court on Thursday. Beeming pleaded guilty to the charge after she was found to be shielding alleged gangster Hans Jordaan, who was being sought by the police while she was employed in the police’s gang unit. Testifying, former gang unit boss Colonel Mike Grobler previously told the court how the actions of Beeming, 34, had an "enormously" negative effect on the unit as well as its relationship with the community. All the cases Beeming had been working on at the time had to be withdrawn and charges dropped against a number of suspects including Jordaan.
