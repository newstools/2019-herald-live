Intensified load-shedding this past weekend has raised questions and created confusion about exactly how load-shedding works in Nelson Mandela Bay. The energy supplier announced load-shedding last Thursday and by the weekend, it had intensified to stage 4 load-shedding during the day, switching to stage 2 overnight. The result?

So, tell us in the comments below this article what you would like to know.
