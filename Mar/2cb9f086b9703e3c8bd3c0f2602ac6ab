Attempts by public enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan and the Eskom board to provide "insight" into problems at the power utility have been rubbished by South Africans, with thousands expressing their anger over a press conference held on Tuesday. Gordhan said at the briefing that the power utility still needs to complete its investigations, which will then allow for concrete answers to be given on how long load-shedding will last. Old power stations and generation capacity dominated the briefing as Gordhan and the Eskom board detailed the technical problems the power utility is experiencing. "We understand the frustration. We donâ€™t have a magic formula. This is not about whether Pravin Gordhan or Jabu Mabuza or Phakamani Hadebe single-handedly have a magic wand that can actually enable us to wave that wand and say load-shedding is over," said Gordhan.Despite promises that there would be another briefing in the next 10 to 14 days, South Africans rallied together in their anger about the power problems, calling on politicians to show more urgency.
