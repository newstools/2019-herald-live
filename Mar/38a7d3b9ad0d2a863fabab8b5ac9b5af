DA MP Phumzile van Damme has responded to a backlash against her for laying a charge against Eskom after she was allegedly assaulted at Medupi power station by security guards. On Wednesday, the DA held a picket outside the Eskom  power station in Limpopo. Van Damme claimed she was "violently shoved" by a security manager and a guard, who also shouted insults at her during the protest. While some offered support, many criticised her over the incident. The DA MP has since clapped back at those who blamed her for the alleged assault, posting a stinging rebuke on Twitter. Van Damme said she had  video evidence of the altercation. She said she expected a full apology from Eskom, but that an apology did not mean she would drop the charge. Police have confirmed that Van Damme had opened a case.
