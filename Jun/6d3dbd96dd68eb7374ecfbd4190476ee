All dads are different and what to get them for Father’s Day on June 16 could be a challenge. With the Nelson Mandela Bay Pass things have gotten a bit easier as you give the pass holder the option to choose what they want to do. “The Nelson Mandela Bay Pass provides you with free admission and discount to over 60 attractions and activities in and around Nelson Mandela Bay,” said Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality's economic development tourism and agriculture executive director Anele Qaba. So if your dad is the adventurous type, he can experience some of the following activities for Father’s Day: For the less adventurous dads there is other options, such as: Check out the Nelson Mandela Bay pass website for all the things you can do and why not buy him one. “We would also like to request that people support local businesses and buy local products as this will help stimulate the local economy. The city has a variety of markets that have a diverse range of locally produced products,” Qaba said. “The whole idea behind our #ShareTheBay campaign is to share what the city has to offer in terms of tourism and locally produced products and we want to encourage local business to use the hashtag to promote their products.” One such a local company is Mastertons. Founded in Port Elizabeth by Ronald John Masterton in 1924, Mastertons Coffee & Tea Specialists have been pioneers in the roasting and blending of top-quality coffee ever since. With a wide range of coffee blends, the finest decaf, a variety of fine teas and coffee accessories, there is more than enough varieties to pick from for that special dad. Mastertons have collaborated with Nelson Mandela Bay Tourism and are giving away a special Father’s Day blend to one lucky winner to spoil their dad! To enter click here. The competition closes on June 14. Prizes to be collected at their new premises at 92 Main Road, in Walmer.
