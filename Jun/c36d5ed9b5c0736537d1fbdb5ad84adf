Hilarious video clips of a soldier unable to keep up during a South African National Defence Force (SANDF) training session made the rounds on social media on Thursday. The first videos show soldiers or trainees practising climbing a wall‚ but one is not as agile as the rest. The recruit‚ Mabena‚ is slow or stops before completing the climb.
