It's a powerful thing, social media. It's magical, and it has changed the lives of many ordinary South Africans across the country in recent months. Social media and technology have made the interests and passions of those around us so diverse. It connects us to the people who share our passions, people who share our values and ideas. From #MyFokMarelize, to pumping tyres and washing windscreens to drinking Woolies "special water", to a talented opera Uber singer - this is how social media has made ordinary South Africans overnight celebrities.

Shell had also pledged to donate R500,000 to a charity of Mbele's choice.
