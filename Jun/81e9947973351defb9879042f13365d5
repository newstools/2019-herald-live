South African taxi drivers are capable of doing just about anything - even racing a Formula 1 car. This weekend Red Bull brought their Formula 1 championship-winning RB7 to Cape Town ahead of the Red Bull Grand Parade event in the city. Video footage of an F1 car racing a taxi at a traffic circle close to the city centre has since emerged. The F1 driver was identified as David Coulthard, while the taxi driver's identity remains a mystery. It's understood full details of the race will be revealed in July.
