Eastern Cape legislature speaker Helen Sauls-August has announced that the budget allocation for the State of the Province Address has been slashed from R5m to R700,000. The speaker was leading a presentation on how the provincial legislature plans to cut costs. Sauls-August said the number of guests would be reduced from 1,200 to 650. “The sitting of the house outside the chamber has been a costly exercise for the legislature and it had to be reviewed within the national spirit of cost cutting,”  she added.
