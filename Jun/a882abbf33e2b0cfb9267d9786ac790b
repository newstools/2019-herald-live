A 64-year-old man was arrested Monday after throwing a gas cannister outside the Greek parliament, a police source said. The gas cannister did not explode and nobody was hurt. The man was found to be carrying another four cannisters, wrapped on sticks, and a small petrol container, the source said. The motive behind the act was not immediately clear. The parliament building is situated on a busy Athens junction and is a frequent target for protests. In May, members of a radical anarchist group threw paint and smoke bombs at the building in support of a jailed prominent member of the far-left Greek extremist organisation November 17.
