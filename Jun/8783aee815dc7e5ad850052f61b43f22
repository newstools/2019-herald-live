South Africans are divided over Shell's R500,000 donation to employee Nkosikho Mbele's charity of  choice, following his gesture of offering to top up a customer's petrol tank. The announcement was made by Shell's chairperson Hloniphizwe Mtolo, who said the company was following suit after members of  the public  donated more than R500,000 to Mbele through  a BackaBuddy crowd-funding initiative. Some have accused the company of being out of touch with the realities of its  employees and "shining on Mbele's shine" for publicity, while others  praised Shell  for its generosity.
