Video footage of an approximately 2.5m black mamba  in a dog kennel at a Durban  home has gone viral. In the footage, snake-catcher Jason Arnold says security guards noticed the snake and called him to help. He says the family was cooking outside when they noticed the massive snake slither in. He managed to safely retrieve it and release it.
