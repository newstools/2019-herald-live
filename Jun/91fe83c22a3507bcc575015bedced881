Hawks spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu said they allegedly colluded with a former CEO at the  fund, who has since died. The pair, aged 30 and 40, appeared before Johannesburg's Specialised Commercial Crime Court on Thursday on  charges of fraud and theft. They were granted bail of R5,000 each. The case was postponed to July 24 pendingÂ  further investigation.
