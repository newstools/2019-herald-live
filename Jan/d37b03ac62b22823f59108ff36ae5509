"Due process will be followed internally to test the credibility of the allegations made by Agrizzi and any other submissions that may arise through the Zondo Commission as they relate to the company." Rasivhaga said. Rasivhaga further stated that ACSA will co-operate with the Zondo Commission. "The company will respond through the appropriate channels, providing necessary information whenever it is required to do so," he said.
