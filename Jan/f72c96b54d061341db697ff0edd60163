Workers clearing plants on a farm inÂ Chonburi, eastern Thailand, got a fright when an enormous python slithered out from the undergrowth. The terrified workers called a local snake rescue group who arrived and made light work of the four-metre-long reptile. After trying to outmanoeuvre the snake catcher's lasso pole, the python was eventually caught on January 14. The serpent was placed in a sack and presumably relocated far away from the farm.
