Nelson Mandela Bay police are appealing to you to keep your eyes peeled for a number of suspected criminals, some of whom have evaded police for years. Warrants of arrest are out for all those featured. Should you spot any of them, please contact the investigating officers rather than approach the suspects. PLEASE NOTE: This article will be updated as and when the suspects are arrested. However, once they are arrested HeraldLIVE can no longer - in terms of the law - use their pictures until they have appeared in court. As a result, the suspects' faces in this article will be blurred once they have been arrested, with a link to an update regarding the arrest.
