Finance minister Tito Mboweni has angered  tweeps by insisting  road users  pay  e-tolls. On Thursday, he took to Twitter to oppose Gauteng premier David Makhura, who said during his state of the province address (Sopa) on Monday that he would ensure the toll system was scrapped. "Our position has not changed. We remain determined that e-tolls are not part of the future of our province."  He went as far as saying that the provincial government was prepared to pay some of the money owed by motorists to ensure the tolling system was scrapped. In a series of tweets, Mboweni did not hold back. He said there should have been a plan at the introduction of e-tolls to ensure  the system worked and yielded returns in the long term. Transport minister Fikile Mbalula chimed in, asking  Mboweni to refrain from issuing conflicting statements on e-tolls. President Cyril Ramaphosa instructed that a meeting be held to discuss a way forward. Social media users took to Twitter to voice their opinions.
