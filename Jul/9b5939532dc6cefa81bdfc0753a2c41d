China urged Washington Tuesday to "immediately cancel" the potential sale of $2.2 billion in weapons to Taiwan, including battle tanks and anti-aircraft missiles. "The sale of weapons by the United States to Taiwan... seriously violates the one-China principle... grossly interferes in China's internal affairs and undermines China's sovereignty and security interests," said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.
