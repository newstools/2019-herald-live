A Johannesburg businessman was abducted in broad daylight during an armed robbery in Mayfair over the weekend. Videos of the incident have been widely shared on social media. Police spokesperson Jeanette Backhoff said that the incident happened on the corner of Bird and Albertina Sisulu roads at around 10am on Saturday. Backhoff said the  businessman was driving with his father and two workers from their business in Newtown, when they were stopped by four armed men. The armed men brought their car to a halt at the robot at the corner of Princes and 6th Avenue in Mayfair. Backhoff said the men pointed firearms at them, but they drove off. She said the armed men then blocked the car off at a red robot further down the road. "They demanded money and R5,000 was given to them. They demanded more money and when they could not get more money, they fired three shots and took the complainant's father, pushed him in their car and drove off with him." The suspects' car was later recovered at Diepkloof hostel in Soweto. She said the complainant's father sustained minor injuries and was taken to hospital. One of the suspects was found with a gunshot wound and an unlicensed firearm in the front seat of the car. He was taken to hospital under police guard. "It seems that the suspects were fighting amongst themselves, and that a shootout occurred between them and that is how one of the suspects got shot." Police have opened cases of kidnapping, attempted murder and armed robbery.
