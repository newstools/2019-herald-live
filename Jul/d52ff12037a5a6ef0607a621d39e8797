The frozen body of a stowaway fell from a plane as it was approaching Heathrow Airport on Sunday. According to MailOnline, the corpse fell into the garden of a London home, landing one metre away from a tenant who was sunbathing at the time. Officials said the corpse fell over a kilometre from a Kenya Airways plane, flying from Nairobi, as it opened its landing gear. A neighbour told MailOnline: 'There was an almighty bang. At first I thought it was some scaffolding falling down and thought nothing more about it." Airline officials said a subsequent search uncovered a bag, water and a stash of food in the plane's landing gear.
